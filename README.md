# ResultAPI

**ResultAPI** is a project designed to help developers quickly and easily start implementing an API using **FastAPI**.

## Overview

Starting a new **FastAPI** project often involves repetitive tasks such as setting up a logger, managing environment variables, and configuring HTTP clients for third-party services. **ResultAPI** aims to streamline these tasks, allowing you to focus on writing your API endpoints and business logic from the outset.

## Features

- **Predefined Directory Structure**: Provides a suggested directory structure to organize your code efficiently.
- **Batteries Included**: Comes with reusable services that offer generic functionalities commonly needed in API development. Contributions for new services are welcome!
- **Python Interpreter Management**: Automatically handles everything related to the Python interpreter. Specify your desired Python version or let **ResultAPI** select one for you.
- **Docker Integration**: Generates Docker and Docker Compose files for containerized deployment, complete with hot-reloading for seamless development.
- **Dependency Management**: Simplifies managing dependencies and third-party libraries using the [Rye](http://rye-up.com) project.
